This is a demo project combining Angualr 5 and Laravel technique developing a simple item interface with
very basic crud functionality. It is still in progression and I am expecting the outer framework to be done
in the next couple of days.

In order for the routing path to work you need to either set up a visual host (http://item/) or modify the server vairable in item service file to match the routing path of laravel controller

Down below are some screenshot of the CRUD Demo
